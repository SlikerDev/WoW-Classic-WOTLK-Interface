### Thank you supporters!
Thank you to all  that support us, either by contributing or donating through patreon: https://www.patreon.com/classiclootmanager.
Special thank you to legendary patrons: **naimious**
## New: Simplified User Interface
### No more bulky windows!
Main CLM windows: Standings, Point History, Loot History, Raids and Profiles are now combined in single window with tabs for ease of use. Additionaly Loot and Point History are now combined into common list.
### No more accidental selection clear!
Selection now works as expected:
- Single click to select a single row,
- Alt-click to select any row,
- Shift-click to select a range of rows.
### Filtering and search!
You can now search through data with ease.
### Visibility and QoL changes!
- You are now highlighted in standings,
- Minimap Icon can now be toggled on and off,
- Sounds can now be toggled on and off,
### Configurable keybinds!

## New: Auction and Bidding UI overhaul
### Auction window now highlights players roles
- blue for Tank
- green for Healer
- red for DPS
### Bidding window received general overhaul and is more compact than ever.
- Supports MS/OS bidding which is displayed in the Auction window. Original - MS bids are green, new OS bids are yellow.
- It can now be toggled by clicking on the timer bar\n- Tooltips will now properly display also when hovering over the item Icon
## New: Action Context mechanism
Previously CLM automatically selected every player in the UI. This is no more happening. With the new selection system there has been introduced a new concept: context. Your point awards will be based on this - either Roster, Raid or selection. By default context is Roster, when you select someone it's changed to selection, and if you're in raid it will default to Raid. Be sure to be aware of the context when working on the points.
## New: EPGP support
### Effort Points / Gear Points support is here!
You can now run simultaneously multiple DKP and EPGP raids and rosters at the same time, using all the great mechanisms CLM provides.
## New: Tiered bidding mode
Dedicated to EPGP but works great for DKP also - this system is a type of ascending bid system, where you can set up to 5 tiers of values which people will pay for an item, for example: 0, 30, 50, 70, 100 - no other values will be accepted by aucioneer. This comes with full UI support.
## New: Named buttons bidding mode
Dedicated to Tiered bidding mode - this allows you to name tiered bid buttons and use them instead of values (although the underlying values are still there). Both players bidding and auctioneer will see the text instead of value, while awarding will still result in the proper point deduction (DKP) or award (GP).
## New: Profile locking
You can now lock (and unlock) profiles. Now any point, either DKP, EP or GP, operations on those profiles, in any roster, will be ignored as long as profiles are locked. Locked players are displayed with red tint.
## Gargul by @Zh0rax integration
Gargul and CLM are coming with new integration for TMB/LC + DKP/EPGP use for more loot systems flexibilty!

### Exports
You can now export `Standings`, `Point History` and ` Loot History` to XML and JSON formats for integration with external tools. Check it through `/clm export` (or minimap icon if you're a Manager). Be aware that XML export for full database can be very heavy and timeout. This happens due to point history size. If this happens for you (e.g. game freezes and no output is produced) try reloading and limiting the export size. New optimizations coming soon!

Fixed missing value rounding for zero-sum bank without caps.
# Classic Loot Manager v1.6.0

## Features
### Attendance tracking

No action might also mean player has not received bid command (was during reload) or has no or outdated addon installed.

## Features
### Time Travel
Have you ever awarded some DKP only a few days later, to realise it was in error? The thought of fixing it is such a hassle since you did a bunch of other stuff since then (eg, decay) and instead of the audit table looking clean now, it's full of manual corrections? Then this feature is for you! With `Time Travel` mode, you can now jump back to a point in time in your audit log and add/remove entries to make corrections / additions in certain point in time! Simply activate time travel through audit GUI and make your changes. They are applied instantly. AddOn management is almost fully available during time traveling. Raid management is disabled during time travel.
### Sandbox
`Sandbox` mode allows you to place the addon in a state where you are disconnected from others. While disconnected, you are free to do whatever you want without the worry of a change affecting your DKP setup. What might this be useful for? Say you bring a new officer into your team and you'd like to assign them the task of managing DKP. With this mode, they can train themselves doing all the normal DKP operations in isolation. If you make a set of changes, you can either choose to apply them or discard them once you are done.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.13.1
## Fixes
### ElvUI compatibility
Fix for ElvUI users which, after patch 2.19, handles UI differently, thus resulting in very weird button placements.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.13.0
## Features
### Loot Queue
You can now track items that you have looted into the inventory and auction them from a convenient list. Toggle it through `/clm queue`. Tracked loot quality can be changed in configuration.
## Fixes
### Alt-Main linking points fix
When alt-main linking in case of alt missing in roster, when that alt was added to roster, there was an error that did set both main and alts standings to 0 instead of keeping current. `Please double check point values if using alt-main linking when moving to this version.`
### Untrusted window display
Profiles, Raid and Audit window are now read-only accessible to all users through `/clm commands`
### Window location storing
Window location is now properly stored and restored when window is moved to the right side of the screen.
## Notes
### Event based communication
Auction Manager now uses events to communication. This is a needed step to allow further AddOn / WeakAuras integration.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.12.0
## Features
### Auditing
Introducing new auditing UI for managers. You can now check every entry created by ledger and restore already ignored entries by ignoring (removing) the original ignore.
## Fixes
### Migration
Migration is now executed with comms disabled and is reversible by wiping entries.
### Hydross DKP award
Hydross DKP boss kill bonus award workaround is now fixed.
### Weekly gains display
Weekly gains are now tracked and displayed even if there is no weekly cap.
### Roster Decay
Roster decay should now use proper, optimised entries. While this is a backwards compatible fix there is marginal chance to lead to DKP difference if profile that had DKP in multiple rosters was removed and then added again. Please double check the values when upgrading to this version.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.11.0
## Features - auto awards
### Raid bonuses
On-time bonus - awarded when starting raid and Raid completion bonus - awarded when ending raid

# Classic Loot Manager v0.10.1
## Hotfix
### Version check
Hotfix version check for lower patch version in bigger minor.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.10.0
## Features
### Zero-Sum DKP
CLM now support Zero-Sum DKP. If you aren't aware of how Zero-Sum works, it's a DKP system where, at a rosters inception, an amount of DKP is awarded to each player and from that point onwards, no new DKP is awarded (although addon does not restrict it). When a player spends DKP (loot is awarded), that DKP is awarded evenly to the rest of the roster.
### Chat commands
You can now use the `!bid X` function to bid (even if you don't have CLM installed). It's not recommended though if you have CLM. Values supported include: value / pass / cancel. You can also get information about your standings through `!dkp`. This function needs to be enabled per trusted person.
### Player search
For convenience, you can now search for players by name on the standings screen. This is particularly helpful to those guilds with large rosters.
### Minimum bid increment
You can now configure minimum bid increment to be used in open auction mode.
## Quality of Life
### Smart DKP award
When applying DKP, CLM is now more context aware depending on filter settings. If you are in a raid, DKP will be assigned to raid members. If you aren't, it'll consider the roster, otherwise it will fall back onto the individual player selection. Alternately, selecting a player (or players) in a raid will override this new behaviour.
### Relaxed auctioning
Auctioning is no longer restricted to the master looter. The raid leader can now perform similar functions. Should also allow for bidding from outside of guild raiders.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.9.3
## Features
### Alerts!
You will now see an alert when: receiving DKP; item is awarded to you; your bid is accepted; your bid is denied.
## Bugfixes
### Spec Sharing
Proper talent information will now be shared.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.9.2
## Fixes
### Invalid point value
Fix for invalid point value due to alt-main linking introduction.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.9.1
## Hotfix
### Fatal
Hotfix fatal code error in some corner cases.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.9.0
## Features
### Link your alt to your main character
You can now link an alt character in a roster to your main for the purposes of sharing DKP. For linking to work, characters must exist in the same roster. When you link and alt to a main, the DKP each character currently has is added together. From that point onwards, when one linked character has their DKP changed, the others will also. Loot and point histories are tracked against the alt-linked character they are applied against so in future, if you disconnect a main from an alt, history and point calculations will be retained seperately (and recalculated). To get started, type: `/clm link alt main`. You can unlink through `/clm unlink alt`. Removing alt-linked main from a roster will also remove the alt - make sure you unlink before you remove a main! Only trusted players can do that.
### CommunityDKP Migration Support
You can now migrate existing data to CLM. This includes: loot history, point history, and the current DKP standings. Configuration is not migrated. Undertaking a migration should be attempted by a GM with existing data backed up incase of a problem. Best practice is to do it as GM being the only one with CLM installed in the guild.
