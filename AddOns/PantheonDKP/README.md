About
--------------
PantheonDKP is a standalone DKP, bidding, boss encounter, and raid management tool, inspired by MonolithDKP, and originally tailor-made for the needs of the Blaumeux Alliance guild, Pantheon.

### DKP Systems
PantheonDKP utilizes a Blind Bid (Second highest amount +1) bidding method currently but will expand into other methods, in the future.

### Features
* Multi-guild support
* Filtering, sorting and searching members and their DKP.
* DKP & Loot History
* Protection against non-officer members from tampering with the addon data.
* Bid window & timer that displays what is currently being auctioned, and how long is left.
* Automatic Raid Invites when whispered
* Guild message timer, that will go off ever 90 seconds for 15 minutes (if you need to AFK during invites).
* Weekly Decay (10%)
* Automatically adding members to the database when they are "Raid Ready".
    - Members are marked as "Raid Ready" when they are at least LVL 68, or are an officer.
* Automatic auction winner announcements, tie announcements or free-roll announcements.
* Raid Tools helper (see Wiki for more info).
