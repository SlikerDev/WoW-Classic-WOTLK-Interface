# Buffomat Classic

Based on Buff'o'mat by GPI.

Maintained by @kvakvs at Github. https://github.com/kvakvs/BuffomatClassic

Compatible with WoW Classic and will be rolled into Classic Burning Crusade. As
I only play Classic and have no idea about retail spells and playstyles, I won't
be paying much attention to it being Retail-compatible.

## About

Buff'o'mat is a semi automatic buff and resurrection system.

Stamina! Int! Spirit! - Does that sound familiar? Buff'o'mat scan the
party/raid-member for missing buffs and with a click it is casted. When three or
more members are missing one buff the group-version is used. It also remembers
you to activate a tracking like "Find Herbs".

Also it will help you to resurrect players by choosing paladins, priests and
shamans first.

## Usage

You need a free macro-slot to use this addon. The main-window has two tabs "
Buff" and "Spells". Under "Buff" you find all missing buffs and a cast button.

Under "Spells" you can configure which spells should be monitored, if it should
use the group version. Select if it should only cast an you or on all party
members. Choose which buff should be active on which class. You can also ignore
complete groups (for example in raid, when you should only cast int on group
7&8). You can also select here, that one buff should be active on the current
target. For example as druid click on the main tank and in the "thorns"
-Section on the "-" (last symbol) - it will changed to a crosshair and now
buff'o'mat remember you to keep the buff on the main tank.

You have two options to Cast a buff from the missing-buff-list. The spell-button
in the window or the "Buff'o'mat"-macro. You find it with the "M"-Button in
the "titelbar" of the main window.

IMPORTANT: Buff'o'mat works only out of combat because Blizzard don't allow to
change macros during combat. Additional you can't open or close the main window
during combat!
